"""
For this task, you are to write a Python script that calculates the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width.

Instructions:

Create a file named rectangle_area.py.
Define two variables in this file:
length with a value representing the length of the rectangle.
width with a value representing the width of the rectangle.
For simplicity, letâ€™s use length = 10 and width = 5.

"""
length = 10 
width = 5

Area = length * width
print(f"The area of the rectangle is: {Area }")

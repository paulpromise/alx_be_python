This week on my alx backend journey, I delved into Conditional Statements in Python. I explored how to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to control the flow of my programs based on different conditions. This knowledge is crucial for making decisions in code, allowing for more dynamic and responsive applications.

Also, I learned about logical operators such as `and`, `or`, and `not`, which help in combining multiple conditions. Understanding these concepts has enhanced my ability to write more complex and efficient code.

I also practiced using nested conditional statements, which allow for more granular control over the program's flow. This week has been a significant step forward in my Python programming skills, and I'm excited to apply these concepts in future projects.# 0x01. Conditional statements in Python

We also used the match statement to simplify complex conditional logic.

I built a daily:
1. reminder app using conditional statements to send notifications based on user preferences.
2. A simple calculator using the match statement to perform different operations based on user input.
3. A basic pattern drawing app that uses conditional statements to create different shapes based on user choices.
4. A simple number guessing game that uses conditional statements to provide feedback to the player.

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum.
